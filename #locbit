#locbit

#generate qr code
#based on a certain id or location


#qr code encodes a link to a mobile app
#displaying a remote control

#open socket.io/now.js connection between remote control app and server
#this is associated with the app running on the large screen

#is there a way to make this a JSONP API that is easily
#embedded in apps?

#so you would just build the app for the screen
#and not have to worry about the socket.io and mobile remote control stuff

#basically turn on CORS
#they link to something like locbit.io/load.js

#to insert qr code:
#org1.locbit

#then they init with loc.init(apikey, screenid);

loc.on = function() {

}

loc.down = function() {

}

loc.right = function() {

}

loc.left = function() {

}

loc.select = function() {

}

loc.on = function(msg) {

}

loc.send = function(msg) {

}

#that actually gets translated to org1.locbit.io/now.js
